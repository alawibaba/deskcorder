A list of things to do:

0) BUGS:
  - Here's a weird one when used with linux.py:
    * Load a file at the start (on the CL)
    * Record without mic plugged in for a brief period.
    * Hit play and watch the weirdness ...

1) Core functionality:
  - Make dummy.GUI() and dummy.Audio() correct
    * add all functions
    * write in "oops" prints

2) Linux GUI:
  - create export dialog for custom positions (as opposed to slides)

3) Cross-platformnes
  - Build me ... probably with Cocoa
  - Build me ... not sure what with.
  - Finish me ... useful?

4) Undo/Redo:
  - Make some buttons ... probably just pop off the last stroke ...
