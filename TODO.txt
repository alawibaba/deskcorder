A list of things to do:

0) BUGS:
  - Here's a weird one when used with linux.py:
    * Load a file at the start (on the CL)
    * Record without mic plugged in for a brief period.
    * Hit play and watch the weirdness ...

1) Core functionality:
  - Make dummy.GUI() and dummy.Audio() correct
    * add all functions
    * write in "oops" prints

2) Export Dialog (GNU/Linux version)
  - create export dialog for custom positions (as opposed to slides)

3) Cross-platformnes
  - Build me ... probably with Cocoa
  - Build me ... not sure what with.
  - Finish me ... useful?

4) Undo/Redo:
  - Make some buttons ... probably just pop off the last stroke ...

5) "go back" feature?
  - I was thinking something that allows you to go back a
    slide to add something you just remembered.
    * This would necessitate altering the timestamps
      sequentially, updating them to "fit" the new stuff in.
    * Find some intuitive way to find the exact place that
      you want the remembered data to be put (assume end?).

6) Progress bar display updates in status (Audio callback?)

7) Mouse cursor change to dot on draw.
