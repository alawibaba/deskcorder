A list of things to do:

1) Core functionality:
  - Make dummy.GUI() and dummy.Audio() correct
    * add all functions
    * write in "oops" prints

2) Linux GUI:
  - use gtk.Builder instead of gtk.glade.XML
    * implement accelerators (menu quick keys)
  - create export dialog for custom positions (as opposed to slides)

3) Mac GUI:
  - Build me ... probably with Cocoa

4) Windows GUI
  - Build me ... not sure what with.

5) Qt GUI
  - Finish me ... useful?
